Project Title: HEAT Labs
The Ultimate Offline Learning Tool for Kano's Future

Problem Statement
In Kano State, students often struggle to bridge the gap between classroom theory and real-world application. Complex subjects, from digital circuits to agricultural science, are taught abstractly, leaving students without the practical understanding needed to innovate. This challenge is compounded by high data costs and poor internet connectivity, which limit access to modern, interactive learning tools.
The Solution
HEAT Labs is a high-tech, offline-first mobile application designed to revolutionize practical education. Our platform provides a suite of Interactive Visual Labs that transform abstract concepts into hands-on, virtual experiences. By leveraging powerful offline technology, HEAT Labs makes advanced, skills-based learning accessible to every student, everywhere in Kano.
Key Features
Offline-First Functionality: The entire application and all its content are stored locally on the device, ensuring a seamless learning experience without the need for an internet connection.
Interactive Visual Labs: A core feature that allows students to build and experiment with concepts in a virtual, risk-free environment. Our prototype demonstrates this with a Transportation Lab where users can:
Drag and drop virtual logic gates (AND, OR, NOT).
Wire the gates together to create a circuit.
Instantly see their logic control a working traffic light simulation.
Peer-to-Peer Sharing: A future-proof feature that will use Bluetooth or local Wi-Fi to enable students to share their creations and collaborate with classmates in person.
Long-Term Vision: Our "moonshot" goal is to develop an AI that can automatically generate these visual labs from a studentâ€™s own lecture notes, creating the ultimate tool for personalized, practical education.
Technology Stack
Mobile App: Built using a cross-platform framework (e.g., Flutter, React Native) for broad device compatibility.
Interactive Labs: Developed with a lightweight game engine (e.g., Unity, Godot) optimized for mobile performance.
Offline Storage: Utilizes local database and file storage to ensure all content is accessible offline.
How to Use the App (Prototype Demo)
Launch the HEAT Labs app. No internet connection is required.
Navigate to the Transportation Lab.
On the screen, you will see a non-working traffic light and a palette of logic gates.
Drag and drop the necessary logic gates onto the screen.
Connect the gates with virtual wires to build the circuit for the traffic light.
Upon completion, the traffic light will automatically activate and begin to cycle, proving your circuit works!
Future Vision
We envision HEAT Labs as a scalable platform that empowers students across Nigeria. Our ultimate goal is to introduce an AI-driven system that transforms theoretical knowledge into interactive experiences, making education a hands-on journey toward a skilled and innovative future.
